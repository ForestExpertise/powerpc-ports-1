description         Modern Fortran edition of REGRIDPACK
long_description    This is an updated and modernized version of REGRIDPACK, \
                    a suite of Fortran routines for interpolating values \
                    between one-, two-, three- and four-dimensional arrays \
                    defined on uniform or nonuniform orthogonal grids. \
                    This operation is commonly referred to as regridding. \
                    Linear or cubic interpolation can be selected independently \
                    in each dimension. Extrapolation is not allowed. \
                    The subroutines in REGRIDPACK cannot be used to transfer values \
                    on non-orthogonal (randomly scattered) data grids.
