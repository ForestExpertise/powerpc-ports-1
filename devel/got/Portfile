description         Game of Trees (Got)
long_description    Game of Trees is a version control system which \
                    prioritizes ease of use and simplicity over flexibility. \
                    Got uses Git repositories to store versioned data. \
                    Git can be used for any functionality which has \
                    not yet been implemented in Got. It will always be \
                    possible to work with both Got and Git on the same \
                    repository.

# In reality it still fails: https://trac.macports.org/ticket/71820
# error: implicit declaration of function 'stravis' is invalid in C99 [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
# Until actually fixed, we stay with a suboptimal hack.
