description         The terminal widget for QTerminal
long_description    QTermWidget is an open-source project originally \
                    based on the KDE4 Konsole application, but it took \
                    its own direction later on. The main goal of this \
                    project is to provide a unicode-enabled, \
                    embeddable Qt widget for using as a built-in \
                    console (or terminal emulation widget).
