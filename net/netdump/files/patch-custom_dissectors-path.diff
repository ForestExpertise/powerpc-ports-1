 To create a custom dissector, refer to the ```netdump-devel``` repo (https://github.com/giorgiopapini/netdump-devel).
 The ```netdump-devel``` package allows you to compile your custom dissector as a shared library. Once compiled as a .so file, you can add it to netdump using the following command:
 ```netdump dissectors -add "path-to-dissector.so"```
-This will place the dissector in the ```~.local/lib/netdump/custom_dissectors/``` directory. Once added, your dissector will be correctly loaded into the netdump program.
+This will place the dissector in the ```@PREFIX@/share/netdump/custom_dissectors/``` directory. Once added, your dissector will be correctly loaded into the netdump program.
 
 ## Benchmark
 I compared netdump with tcpdump in terms of speed, and these are the results I obtained (I disabled hostname resolution in tcpdump to make it faster).
